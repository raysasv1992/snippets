            <p>This was an amazing exercise which made me think creatively about the way of communicating the right
                message to users since they had characters limit and I had to comply with them to create headlines, body texts
                and buttons.</p>
            <p>I found it a very pleasant and fun experience because I was able  to combine it with my passion for
                designing and illustrating which allowed me to create new UI iOS styles</p>
            <p>All the designs below are my creations, Enjoy!</p>
